# The Pain Of Python
## Why I hate python, but written in python.

### How to use
First go [here](https://github.com/cainy-a/PainOfPython/releases) to grab the python file where i had to compress all the files into just one.

Alternatively, just clone the repo and use `main.py`. It makes no difference.

Then make sure you have Python 3 NOT 2 (I discuss his issue in the program).

Finally, run `python3 PainOfPython.py` (or `python3 main.py` if you cloned)
